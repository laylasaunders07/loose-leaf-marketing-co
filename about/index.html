                    Loose Leaf Marketing began as a one-person company until the founder (me) 
                    decided they wanted a change of scenery and redesigned the entire business, 
                    essentially starting right from scratch. Hiring her best friend to work on 
                    web design and to take care of the more technical sides of things, we are 
                    now a two-person, female-led business focusing on offering services such 
                    as marketing, advertising, graphic design, proofreading, editorial as well 
                    as merchandise design and distribution. We pride ourselves on being an 
                    AI-free business; our services are all 100% organic and human-made. In a 
                    world taken over by technology, we believe that real marketing and design 
                    comes from honest, hard work.

                    Hello! I’m Elise, and I am a full-time university student studying Marketing 
                    Management. I originally started this business in 2024 as I wanted a job where 
                    I could utilise my skillset properly and not letting them go to waste with your 
                    average part-time work. However working alone can be quite demanding especially 
                    with A-Level exams coming up. I decided to take a break; when I came back to it 
                    I wanted to completely restart over again after starting university, and recruited 
                    my best friend to assist me along the way so the process felt less pressured and 
                    it took some responsibilities away too so I could focus on what I do best.
